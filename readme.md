# Verilog Learning
Currently working in "Quick Start Guide to Verilog" by Brock J. LaMeres

## Format
Each folder represents a simple module that I write for practice

Inside there is the hdl, test-bench and `_run.sh` to compile and simulate

## Toolchain
Toolchain setup is roughly based on repl.it env script, but modified to run locally on macos

Icarus Verilog for compilation and GTKWave for waveform simulation
